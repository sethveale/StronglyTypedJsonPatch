# Contributing

I'll try and accept pull requests.

I will only accept the existing Visual Studio and build configuration as this is partly a compatibility library for .NET 4.5.2

The code needs to build without warnings from the compiler, code analysis and code contracts.
It also needs to have an appropriate level of testing.

If something is a bug or improvement and you have some untested code that fixes it, post it as an issue and I'll see if I can be bothered writing tests for it.

## The .NET Foundation

This code is a fork from the AspNet/JsonPatch library. Perhaps contribute there.
I just wanted something strongly typed and built against .NET 4.5.2 so that all the tools would work.

## CodeContracts.NET

The latest version can be found here: [https://github.com/Microsoft/CodeContracts/releases]

## Git Flow

This uses git flow and GitVersionTask so keep that in mind.
In general, PR a feature/<your thing> branch and I can sort that side of things out.

## CI

There is no spoon... ah CI.
